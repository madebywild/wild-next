# Next.JS

The boilerplate and parts of this guide assume that the Next.JS instance will be running on a [Laravel Forge Server](/server-setup). Make sure you have setup a server and all necessary AWS buckets and accounts!

## Getting started

Setup a new repository using the [wild-next boilerplate](https://github.com/madebywild/wild-next).

## The boilerplate

The boilerplate includes a set of default plugins and settings.

## Local development

This guide assumes you have a working dev machine with common tools and a console available. We use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage our node versions. Make sure to install the `nvm` package if you havent already.

- CD into the root directory and run `nvm use` to switch to the correct node version.
- Run `npm i` to install dependencies.
- Run `npm run dev` to start the dev server.

### Available commands

<Code language="json">{JSON.stringify(scripts, null, 4)}</Code>
